The application uses technologies like TypeScript, React, Next.js, MongoDB, Prisma, and SCSS.

 User can register using Google, GitHub, or through their email address.
 
After logging in, the user can list their property for rent by providing categories, price, location, title, description, and details related to their property. The user can add properties to their favorites and make reservations for the properties.

This application is inspired by Airbnb, but the design differs significantly.
